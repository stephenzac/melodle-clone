# Soundle

Because I have passions in both music and software development, I created Soundle as a fun little ear training game for you musicians out there. The game will generate 5 random pitches, and you get 6 chances to guess the exact pitches in the order it was played (in concert pitch). Unlike other Wordle-like games, you aren't limited to one game per day: you can replay and guess melodies as many times as you'd like.

I developed Soundle using Typescript, React, and Tailwind CSS. I found much use in React Contexts and Typescript to represent the state of the game and handle the game logic behind the scenes. This project was also a good chance for me to learn the basics of Tailwind CSS.

I used Tone.js to generate and play the pitches of the randomly generated melodies.

This game is a variation of the web application Melodle, built by Matias Meno.
